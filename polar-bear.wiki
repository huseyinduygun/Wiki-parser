The '''polar bear''' (''[[wikt:ursus#Latin|Ursus]] [[wikt:maritimus#Latin|maritimus]]'') is a [[carnivorous]] [[bear]] whose native range lies largely within the [[Arctic Circle]], encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the [[omnivore|omnivorous]] [[Kodiak bear]] (''Ursus arctos middendorffi'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/polar_bear.pdf |format=PDF |title=Polar bear, (''Ursus maritimus'') |publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife service |accessdate=9 September 2009 |quote=Appearance.

However, the two species have mated intermittently for all that time, most likely coming into contact with each other during warming periods, when polar bears were driven onto land and brown bears migrated northward.

The polar bear is found in the Arctic Circle and adjacent land masses as far south as [[Newfoundland (Island)|Newfoundland Island]]. Due to the absence of human development in its remote habitat, it retains more of its original range than any other [[extant taxon|extant]] [[carnivore]].<ref name="derocher2004" /> While they are rare north of 88°, there is evidence that they range all the way across the Arctic, and as far south as [[James Bay]] in Canada. Their southernmost range is near the boundary between the [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] and [[humid continental climate]] zones. They can occasionally [[drift ice|drift]] widely with the sea ice, and there have been anecdotal sightings as far south as [[Berlevåg]] on the Norwegian mainland and the [[Kuril Islands]] in the [[Sea of Okhotsk]]. It is difficult to estimate a global population of polar bears as much of the range has been poorly studied; however, biologists use a working estimate of about 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears worldwide.<ref name="iucn3.1">{{IUCN2013.1|assessors=Schliebe, S., Wiig, Ø., Derocher, A. & Lunn, N.

The range includes the territory of five nations: [[Denmark]] ([[Greenland]]), [[Norway]] ([[Svalbard]]), [[Russia]], the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]) and [[Canada]]. These five nations are the signatories of the [[International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears]], which mandates cooperation on research and conservation efforts throughout the polar bear's range.

Modern methods of tracking polar bear populations have been implemented only since the mid-1980s, and are expensive to perform consistently over a large area.<ref name="campbell" /> The most accurate counts require flying a helicopter in the [[Climate of the Arctic|Arctic climate]] to find polar bears, shooting a tranquilizer dart at the bear to sedate it, and then tagging the bear.<ref name="campbell" /> In [[Nunavut]], some Inuit have reported increases in bear sightings around human settlements in recent years, leading to a belief that populations are increasing.

===Hunting and diet===

The polar bear is the most carnivorous member of the bear family, and throughout most of its range, its diet primarily consists of [[Ringed seal|ringed]] (''Pusa hispida'') and [[bearded seal]]s (''Erignathus barbatus'').<ref>{{cite episode |title=Arctic Bears |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/arcticbears/index.html |series=PBS Nature |serieslink=Nature (TV series) |airdate=17 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080616221443/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/arcticbears/index.html |archivedate=16 June 2008}}</ref> The Arctic is home to millions of seals, which become prey when they surface in holes in the ice in order to breathe, or when they haul out on the ice to rest.<ref name="matthews73-88">[[#Matthews|Matthews]], pp. 73–88</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |author1=Dyck, M.

The polar bear's most common hunting method is called ''still-hunting'':<ref name="hemstock24-27">[[#Hemstock|Hemstock]], pp. 24–27</ref> The bear uses its excellent sense of smell to locate a seal breathing hole, and crouches nearby in silence for a seal to appear. The bear may lay in wait for several hours. When the seal exhales, the bear smells its breath, reaches into the hole with a forepaw, and drags it out onto the ice. The polar bear kills the seal by biting its head to crush its skull. The polar bear also hunts by stalking seals resting on the ice: Upon spotting a seal, it walks to within {{convert|100|yd|-1|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, and then crouches. If the seal does not notice, the bear creeps to within {{convert|30|to|40|ft|0|disp=flip|abbr=on}} of the seal and then suddenly rushes forth to attack.<ref name="matthews73-88" /> A third hunting method is to raid the birth lairs that female seals create in the snow.<ref name="hemstock24-27" />

A widespread legend tells that polar bears cover their black noses with their paws when hunting. This behaviour, if it happens, is rare – although the story exists in native [[oral history]] and in accounts by early [[Arctic exploration|Arctic explorers]], there is no record of an eyewitness account of the behaviour in recent decades.<ref name="behavior" />

===Dietary flexibility===
Although seal predation is the primary and an indispensable way of life for most polar bears, when alternatives are present they are quite flexible. Polar bears will consume a wide variety of other wild foods, including [[muskox]] (''Ovibos moschatus''), [[reindeer]] (''Rangifer tarandus''),<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Richard H|title=The Food Habits of Polar Bears of James Bay and Southwest Hudson Bay in Summer and Autumn|journal=Arctic|date=1975|volume=28|issue=2|pages=117–129|accessdate=21 November 2014|doi=10.14430/arctic2823}}</ref> birds, eggs, [[rodent]]s, [[crab]]s, other [[crustacean]]s and other polar bears. They may also eat plants,<ref name="ReferenceB" /> including [[berry|berries]], [[root]]s, and [[kelp]],<ref name="ReferenceB" /> however none of these are a significant part of their diet,<ref name="Clarkson1994" /> except that beachcast [[marine mammal]] carcasses are an exception. When stalking land animals, such as [[muskox]], [[reindeer]],<ref name="ReferenceB" /> and even [[willow ptarmigan]] (''Lagopus lagopus''), polar bears appear to make use of vegetative cover and wind direction to bring them as close to their prey as possible before attacking. Polar bears have been observed to hunt the small [[Svalbard reindeer]] (''R. t. platyrhynchus''), which weigh only {{convert|40|to|60|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} as adults, as well as the [[barren-ground caribou]] (''R. t. groenlandicus''), which is about twice as heavy as that.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s003000000138|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225349127_Predation_of_Svalbard_reindeer_by_polar_bears |title=Predation of Svalbard reindeer by polar bears |journal=Polar Biology |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=675–678 |year=2000 |last1=Derocher |first1=A.

Like the brown bear, most ungulate prey of polar bears is likely to be young, sickly or injured specimens rather than healthy adults.<ref name="Brook" /> The polar bear's biology is specialized to require large amounts of fat from marine mammals, and it cannot derive sufficient caloric intake from terrestrial food.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramsay |first1=M.

In their southern range, especially near [[Hudson Bay]] and [[James Bay]] Canada polar bears endure all summer without sea ice to hunt from.<ref name="ReferenceB" /> Here, their food ecology shows their dietary flexibility. They still manage to consume some seals, but they are food-deprived in summer as only marine mammal carcasses are an important alternative without sea ice, especially carcasses of the [[beluga whale]]. These alternatives may reduce the rate of weight loss of bears when on land.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Derocher, Andrew E.; Andriashek, Dennis; Stirling, Ian|first1=Arctic|title=Terrestrial Foraging by Polar Bears During the Ice-Free Period in Western Hudson Bay.|date=1993|volume=46|issue=3|pages=251–254|jstor=40511413}}</ref> One scientist found that 71% of the [[Hudson Bay]] bears had fed on seaweed ([[marine algae]]) and that about half were feeding on birds<ref name="link.springer.com" /> like [[sea ducks]], especially the [[oldsquaw]] (53%), [[common eider]], [[long-tailed duck]] or [[dovekie]] by swimming underwater to catch them. They were also diving to feed on [[blue mussel]]s and other underwater food sources like the [[green sea urchin]]. 24% had eaten [[moss]] recently, 19% had consumed grass, 34% had eaten [[black crowberry]] and about half had consumed [[willow]]s.<ref name="ReferenceB" /> This study illustrates the polar bear's dietary flexibility but it does not represent its life history elsewhere. Most polar bears elsewhere will never have access to these alternatives, except for the marine mammal carcasses that are important wherever they occur.

In Svalbard, polar bears were observed to kill [[white-beaked dolphin]]s during spring, when the dolphins were trapped in the sea ice. The bears then proceeded to [[hoarding (animal behavior)|cache]] the carcasses, which remained and were eaten during the ice-free summer and autumn.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Aars |first=Jon |last2=Andersen |first2=Magnus |last3=Brenière |first3=Agnès |last4=Blanc |first4=Samuel |date=1 June 2015 |title=White-beaked dolphins trapped in the ice and eaten by polar bears |url=http://www.polarresearch.net/index.php/polar/article/view/26612 |journal=Polar Research |publisher=|volume=34 |issue=|pages=|doi=10.3402/polar.v34.26612 |access-date=12 June 2015}}</ref>

==Behaviour==
[[File:Polar Bears Play fight.JPG|thumb|right|Subadult polar bear males frequently play-fight. During the mating season, actual fighting is intense and often leaves scars or broken teeth.]]
Unlike grizzly bears, polar bears are not [[territory (animal)|territorial]]. Although stereotyped as being voraciously aggressive, they are normally cautious in confrontations, and often choose to escape rather than fight.<ref name="matthews2729">[[#Matthews|Matthews]], pp. 27–29</ref> Satiated polar bears rarely attack humans unless severely provoked. However, due to their lack of prior human interaction, hungry polar bears are extremely unpredictable, fearless towards people and are known to kill and sometimes eat humans.<ref name="bruemmer2533">[[#Bruemmer|Bruemmer]], pp. 25–33</ref> Many attacks by [[brown bear]]s are the result of surprising the animal, which is not the case with the polar bear. Polar bears are stealth hunters, and the victim is often unaware of the bear's presence until the attack is underway.<ref name="conflicts" /> Whereas brown bears often maul a person and then leave, polar bear attacks are more likely to be predatory and are almost always fatal.<ref name="conflicts">{{cite book|last=Stirling |first=Ian |year=1988 |title=Polar Bears |location=Ann Arbor |authorlink=Ian Stirling (biologist) |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-10100-5 |chapter=Distribution and Abundance}}</ref> However, due to the very small human population around the [[Arctic]], such attacks are rare. [[Michio Hoshino]], a [[Japan]]ese wildlife photographer, was once pursued briefly by a hungry male polar bear in northern Alaska. According to Hoshino, the bear started running but Hoshino made it to his truck. The bear was able to reach the truck and tore one of the doors off the truck before Hoshino was able to drive off.<ref>Hoshino, M. ''Hoshino's Alaska''. Chronicle Books (2007), ISBN 0811856518.</ref>

In general, adult polar bears live solitary lives. Yet, they have often been seen playing together for hours at a time and even sleeping in an embrace,<ref name="bruemmer2533" /> and polar bear zoologist Nikita Ovsianikov has described adult males as having "well-developed friendships."<ref name="matthews2729" /> Cubs are especially playful as well. Among young males in particular, play-fighting may be a means of practicing for serious competition during mating seasons later in life.<ref>[[#Matthews|Matthews]], p. 95</ref> Polar bears have a wide range of vocalisations, including bellows, roars, growls, chuffs and purrs.<ref>''Bear Behaviour and Activities'' from Gary Brown's ''The Great Bear Almanac'', Lyons & Burford, Publishers, 1993</ref>

In 1992, a photographer near Churchill took a now widely circulated set of photographs of a polar bear playing with a [[Canadian Eskimo Dog]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') a tenth of its size.<ref name="rosing128132" /><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20140318174652/http://nifplay.org/polar-husky.html Why Didn't the Wild Polar Bear eat the Husky?] The National Institute for Play</ref> The pair wrestled harmlessly together each afternoon for ten days in a row for no apparent reason, although the bear may have been trying to demonstrate its friendliness in the hope of sharing the kennel's food.<ref name="rosing128132">[[#Rosing|Rosing]], pp. 128–132</ref> This kind of social interaction is uncommon; it is far more typical for polar bears to behave aggressively towards dogs.<ref name="rosing128132" />

===Reproduction and lifecycle===
[[File:Ursus maritimus us fish.jpg|thumb|Cubs are born helpless and typically nurse for two and a half years]]
Courtship and mating take place on the sea ice in April and May, when polar bears congregate in the best seal hunting areas.<ref name="reproduction" /> A male may follow the tracks of a breeding female for {{convert|100|km|-1|abbr=on}} or more, and after finding her engage in intense fighting with other males over mating rights, fights that often result in scars and broken teeth.<ref name="reproduction" /> Polar bears have a generally [[polygyny|polygynous]] mating system; recent genetic testing of mothers and cubs, however, has uncovered cases of litters in which cubs have different fathers.<ref name="carpenter">{{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=Tom|date=November–December 2005|title=Who's Your Daddy?|journal=Canadian Geographic|publisher=The Royal Canadian Geographic Society|location=Ottawa|pages=44–56}}</ref> Partners stay together and mate repeatedly for an entire week; the mating ritual induces [[ovulation]] in the female.<ref name="rosing42-48">[[#Rosing|Rosing]], pp. 42–48</ref>

After mating, the fertilized egg remains in a suspended state until August or September. During these four months, the pregnant female eats prodigious amounts of food, gaining at least {{convert|200|kg|abbr=on}} and often more than doubling her body weight.<ref name="reproduction" />

====Maternity denning and early life====
[[File:Sea ice pb den.jpg|thumb|right|Female emerging from her maternity den]]
When the ice floes break up in the fall, ending the possibility of hunting, each pregnant female digs a ''maternity den'' consisting of a narrow entrance tunnel leading to one to three chambers.<ref name="reproduction" /> Most maternity dens are in snowdrifts, but may also be made underground in [[permafrost]] if it is not sufficiently cold yet for snow.<ref name="reproduction" /> In most subpopulations, maternity dens are situated on land a few kilometers from the coast, and the individuals in a subpopulation tend to reuse the same denning areas each year.<ref name="derocher2004" /> The polar bears that do not den on land make their dens on the sea ice. In the den, she enters a dormant state similar to [[hibernation]]. This hibernation-like state does not consist of continuous sleeping; however, the bear's heart rate slows from 46 to 27 beats per minute.<ref name="lockwood17-21">[[#Lockwood|Lockwood]], pp.17–21</ref> Her body temperature does not decrease during this period as it would for a typical mammal in hibernation.<ref name="stirling1988" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bruce |first1=D.

Between November and February, cubs are born blind, covered with a light down fur, and weighing less than {{convert|0.9|kg|abbr=on}},<ref name="rosing42-48" /> but in captivity they might be delivered in the earlier months. The earliest recorded birth of polar bears in captivity was on 11 October 2011 in the [[Toronto Zoo]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/rejected-by-their-mother-polar-cubs-now-under-intensive-care-at-toronto-zoo/article2199799/?utm_medium=Feeds%3A%20RSS%2FAtom&utm_source=Home&utm_content=2199799 |title=Rejected by their mother, polar cubs now under intensive care at Toronto Zoo |date=13 October 2011}}</ref> On average, each litter has two cubs.<ref name="reproduction" /> The family remains in the den until mid-February to mid-April, with the mother maintaining her fast while nursing her cubs on a fat-rich milk.<ref name="reproduction" /> By the time the mother breaks open the entrance to the den, her cubs weigh about {{convert|10|to|15|kg}}.<ref name="reproduction" /> For about 12 to 15 days, the family spends time outside the den while remaining in its vicinity, the mother grazing on vegetation while the cubs become used to walking and playing.<ref name="reproduction" /> Then they begin the long walk from the denning area to the sea ice, where the mother can once again catch seals.<ref name="reproduction" /> Depending on the timing of ice-floe breakup in the fall, she may have fasted for up to eight months.<ref name="reproduction" /> During this time, cubs playfully imitate the mother's hunting methods in preparation for later life.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ice Bear: The Arctic World of Polar Bears |last=Kazlowski |first=Steven |publisher=The Mountaineers Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-59485-486-6 |location=Seattle, WA |pages=12 |last2=Stirling |first2=Ian}}</ref>

Polar bears injured in fights or accidents may either die from their injuries or become unable to hunt effectively, leading to starvation.<ref name="pbi_survival" />

===Ecological role===
The polar bear is the [[apex predator]] within its range. Several animal species, particularly [[Arctic fox]]es (''Vulpes lagopus'') and [[glaucous gull]]s (''Larus hyperboreus''), routinely scavenge polar bear kills.<ref name="behavior" />

The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears is so close that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals.<ref name="amstrup2007" /> The [[evolutionary pressure]] of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]], where there is no major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice.<ref name="behavior" /> The baby fur of most Arctic seal species is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic seals all have dark fur at birth.<ref name="behavior" />

===Long distance swimmer===
Researchers tracked 52 sows in the southern [[Beaufort Sea]] off Alaska with GPS system collars; no boars were involved in the study due to males' necks being too thick for the GPS-equipped collars. Fifty long-distance swims were recorded; the longest at {{convert|354|km}}, with an average of {{convert|155|km}}. The length of these swims ranged from most of a day to ten days. Ten of the sows had a cub swim with them and after a year, six cubs survived. The study did not determine if the others lost their cubs before, during, or some time after their long swims. Researchers do not know whether or not this is a new behaviour; before polar ice shrinkage, they opined that there was probably neither the need nor opportunity to swim such long distances.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/02/us-usa-polarbears-idUSBRE84100W20120502 |title=Polar bears can swim vast distances, study finds |first=Yereth |last=Rosen |agency=Reuters |date=1 May 2012 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref>

==Hunting==

===Indigenous people===
[[File:Greenland-polarbear-skin hg.jpg|thumb|Skins of hunted polar bears]]
Polar bears have long provided important raw materials for Arctic peoples, including the Inuit, [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]], [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], [[Nenets people|Nenets]], Russian [[Pomors]] and others. Hunters commonly used teams of dogs to distract the bear, allowing the hunter to spear the bear or shoot it with arrows at closer range.<ref name="original" /> Almost all parts of captured animals had a use.<ref name="lw6-9" /> The fur was used in particular to make trousers and, by the Nenets, to make galoshes-like outer footwear called ''tobok''; the [[meat]] is edible, despite some risk of [[trichinosis]]; the fat was used in food and as a fuel for lighting homes, alongside seal and whale blubber; [[Tendon|sinews]] were used as thread for sewing clothes; the [[gallbladder]] and sometimes [[Myocardium|heart]] were dried and powdered for medicinal purposes; the large canine teeth were highly valued as [[Amulet|talismans]].<ref name="Uspensky" /> Only the [[liver]] was not used, as its high concentration of [[Retinol|vitamin A]] is poisonous.<ref> As a carnivore, which feeds largely upon [[fish]]-eating carnivores, the polar bear ingests large amounts of [[Retinol|vitamin A]] that is stored in their [[liver]]s.

===History of commercial harvest===
In Russia, polar bear furs were already being commercially traded in the 14th century, though it was of low value compared to Arctic fox or even reindeer fur.<ref name="Uspensky" /> The growth of the human population in the Eurasian Arctic in the 16th and 17th century, together with the advent of firearms and increasing trade, dramatically increased the harvest of polar bears.<ref name="stirling1988" /><ref name="nwt">{{cite web |url=http://wildlife.enr.gov.nt.ca/NWTWildlife/bears/PolarBear/management.htm |title=Polar Bear Management |publisher=Government of the Northwest Territories |accessdate=14 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504105354/http://wildlife.enr.gov.nt.ca/NWTWildlife/bears/PolarBear/management.htm |archivedate=4 May 2008}}</ref> However, since polar bear fur has always played a marginal commercial role, data on the historical harvest is fragmentary. It is known, for example, that already in the winter of 1784/1785 Russian Pomors on [[Spitsbergen]] harvested 150 polar bears in [[Magdalenefjorden]].<ref name="Uspensky" /> In the early 20th century, Norwegian hunters were harvesting 300 bears per year at the same location. Estimates of total historical harvest suggest that from the beginning of the 18th century, roughly 400 to 500 animals were being harvested annually in northern Eurasia, reaching a peak of 1,300 to 1,500 animals in the early 20th century, and falling off as the numbers began dwindling.<ref name="Uspensky" />

In the first half of the 20th century, mechanized and overpoweringly efficient methods of hunting and trapping came into use in North America as well.<ref name="bruemmer93-111" /> Polar bears were chased from [[snowmobile]]s, [[icebreaker]]s, and airplanes, the latter practice described in a 1965 ''New York Times'' editorial as being "about as sporting as machine gunning a cow."<ref name="bruemmer93-111">[[#Bruemmer|Bruemmer]], pp. 93–111</ref> The numbers taken grew rapidly in the 1960s, peaking around 1968 with a global total of 1,250 bears that year.<ref name="PBSG2">{{cite conference |date=February 1970 |conference=Polar Bears |conferenceurl=http://pbsg.npolar.no/ |title=Proceedings of the 2nd Working Meeting of Polar Bear Specialists |publisher=[[IUCN]] |location=Morges, Switzerland |url=http://pbsg.npolar.no/Meetings/PressReleases/02-Morges.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504190729/http://pbsg.npolar.no/Meetings/PressReleases/02-Morges.htm |archivedate=4 May 2008 |accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref>

===Contemporary regulations===
[[File:Polar-Bear-Warning-Longyearbyen.jpg|thumb|right|Road sign warning about the presence of polar bears]]
Concerns over the future survival of the species led to the development of national regulations on polar bear hunting, beginning in the mid-1950s. The Soviet Union banned all hunting in 1956. Canada began imposing hunting quotas in 1968. Norway passed a series of increasingly strict regulations from 1965 to 1973, and has completely banned hunting since then. The United States began regulating hunting in 1971 and adopted the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] in 1972. In 1973, the [[International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears]] was signed by all five nations whose territory is inhabited by polar bears: Canada, Denmark, Norway, the [[Soviet Union]], and the United States. Member countries agreed to place restrictions on recreational and commercial hunting, ban hunting from aircraft and icebreakers, and conduct further research.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030409113042/http://pbsg.npolar.no/ConvAgree/agreement.htm International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears], 15 November 1973, Oslo</ref> The treaty allows hunting "by local people using traditional methods". Norway is the only country of the five in which all harvest of polar bears is banned. The agreement was a rare case of international cooperation during the [[Cold War]]. Biologist [[Ian Stirling (biologist)|Ian Stirling]] commented, "For many years, the conservation of polar bears was the only subject in the entire Arctic that nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain could agree upon sufficiently to sign an agreement. Such was the intensity of human fascination with this magnificent predator, the only marine bear."<ref>[[Ian Stirling (biologist)|Stirling, Ian]] ''Foreword'' in {{cite book |title=The World of the Polar Bear|last=Rosing |first=Norbert |year=1996 |publisher=Firefly Books Ltd. |location=Willowdale, ON |isbn=1-55209-068-X}}</ref>

Agreements have been made between countries to co-manage their shared polar bear subpopulations. After several years of negotiations, Russia and the United States signed an agreement in October 2000 to jointly set quotas for indigenous subsistence hunting in Alaska and [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE3DD1F3FF934A25753C1A9669C8B63|title=U.S. and Russia sign pact to protect the polar bear |work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 April 2008|date=17 October 2000}}</ref> The treaty was ratified in October 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071014202952.htm|title=US-Russia Polar Bear Treaty Ratified|date=18 October 2007|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=12 April 2008}}</ref>

====Russia====
The Soviet Union banned the harvest of polar bears in 1956, however poaching continued and is estimated to pose a serious threat to the polar bear population.<ref name="PBSG14" /> In recent years, polar bears have approached coastal villages in Chukotka more frequently due to the shrinking of the sea ice, endangering humans and raising concerns that illegal hunting would become even more prevalent.<ref name="myers" /> In 2007, the Russian government made subsistence hunting legal for Chukotka natives only, a move supported by Russia's most prominent bear researchers and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] as a means to curb poaching.<ref name="myers">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/world/europe/16polar.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title=Russia tries to save polar bears with legal hunt |author=Myers, Steven Lee |work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 April 2008|date=16 April 2007}}</ref>

====Greenland====
In Greenland, hunting restrictions were first introduced in 1994 and expanded by executive order in 2005.<ref name="PBSG14" /> Until 2005 Greenland placed no limit on hunting by indigenous people. However, in 2006 it imposed a limit of 150, while also allowed recreational hunting for the first time.<ref>Rose, Naomi A.

====Canada====
[[File:Dogsledquebec.jpg|thumb|[[Dogsled]]s are used for recreational hunting of polar bears in [[Canada]]. Use of motorized vehicles is forbidden.]]
About 500 bears are killed per year by humans across Canada, a rate calculated by scientists to be unsustainable for some areas, notably [[Baffin Bay]].<ref name="PBI" /> Canada has allowed sport hunters accompanied by local guides and dog-sled teams since 1970,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Freeman |first1=M.M.R. |last2=Wenzel |first2=G.W. |date=March 2006 |title=The nature and significance of polar bear conservation hunting in the Canadian Arctic |journal=Arctic |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=21–30}}</ref> but the practice was not common until the 1980s.<ref name="wenzel2005" /> The guiding of sport hunters provides meaningful employment and an important source of income for native communities in which economic opportunities are few.<ref name="campbell" /> Sport hunting can bring CDN$20,000 to $35,000 per bear into northern communities, which until recently has been mostly from American hunters.<ref name="nunavut">{{cite news |title=Nunavut hunters can kill more polar bears this year |publisher=CBC News |date=10 January 2005 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nunavut-hunters-can-kill-more-polar-bears-this-year-1.535153 }}</ref>

The territory of [[Nunavut]] accounts for the location 80% of annual kills in Canada.

Because of the way polar bear hunting quotas are managed in Canada, attempts to discourage sport hunting would actually increase the number of bears killed in the short term.<ref name="campbell" /> Canada allocates a certain number of permits each year to sport and subsistence hunting, and those that are not used for sport hunting are re-allocated to Native subsistence hunting. Whereas Native communities kill all the polar bears they are permitted to take each year, only half of sport hunters with permits actually manage to kill a polar bear. If a sport hunter does not kill a polar bear before his or her permit expires, the permit cannot be transferred to another hunter.<ref name="campbell" />

====United States====
The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 afforded polar bears some protection in the United States. It banned hunting (except by indigenous substinence hunters), banned importing of polar bear parts (except polar bear pelts taken legally in Canada), and banned the harassment of polar bears. On 15 May 2008, the United States department of Interior listed the polar bear as a threatened species under the [[Endangered Species Act]] and banned all importing of polar bear trophies. Importing products made from polar bears had been prohibited from 1972 to 1994 under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and restricted between 1994 and 2008. Under those restrictions, permits from the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS) were required to import sport-hunted polar bear trophies taken in hunting expeditions in Canada. The permit process required that the bear be taken from an area with quotas based on sound management principles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/bear-facts/hunting/ |title=Bear Facts: Harvesting/Hunting |publisher=Polar Bears International |accessdate=14 March 2008}}</ref> Since 1994, more than 800 sport-hunted polar bear trophies have been imported into the U.S.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20081126220037/https://community.hsus.org/campaign/FED_2007_polar_bear_trophy2 "Support the Polar Bear Protection Act"].

==Conservation status, efforts and controversies==
[[File:Polar Bear Habitat.png|thumb|Map from the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] shows projected changes in polar bear habitat from 2001 to 2010 and 2041 to 2050. Red areas indicate loss of optimal polar bear habitat; blue areas indicate gain.]]

Estimates of the status of the global population of polar bears vary widely. As of 2008, the [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) reports that the global population of polar bears is 20,000 to 25,000, and is declining.<ref name="iucn3.1" /> In 2006, the IUCN upgraded the polar bear from a species of [[least concern]] to a [[vulnerable species]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Release of the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species reveals ongoing decline of the status of plants and animals |url=http://www.iucn.org/en/news/archive/2006/05/02_pr_red_list_en.htm |work=World Conservation Union |accessdate=1 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512071333/http://www.iucn.org/en/news/archive/2006/05/02_pr_red_list_en.htm |archivedate=12 May 2006}}</ref> It cited a "suspected population reduction of >30% within three generations (45 years)".<ref name="iucn3.1" /> However, a report published in July 2013, estimates that the global population of polar bears increased by an average of almost 4,200 bears since 2001.<ref>{{cite web |title=Global population of polar bears has increased by 2,650 to 5,700 since 2001 |url=http://polarbearscience.com/2013/07/15/global-population-of-polar-bears-has-increased-by-2650-5700-since-2001/ |work=Polar Bear Science |accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref> Risks to the polar bear include [[climate change]], [[pollution]] in the form of [[toxic]] contaminants, conflicts with shipping, stresses from recreational polar-bear watching, and oil and gas exploration and development.<ref name="iucn3.1" /> The IUCN also cited a "potential risk of [[over-harvest]]" through legal and illegal hunting.<ref name="iucn3.1" />

According to the [[World Wildlife Fund]], the polar bear is important as an indicator of Arctic [[ecosystem health]]. Polar bears are studied to gain understanding of what is happening throughout the Arctic, because at-risk polar bears are often a sign of something wrong with the Arctic [[marine ecosystem]].<ref>[http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/finder/polarbear/polarbear.html# WWF: A Leader in Polar Bear Conservation].

The key danger posed by climate change is malnutrition or starvation due to [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]]. Polar bears hunt seals from a platform of sea ice. Rising temperatures cause the sea ice to melt earlier in the year, driving the bears to shore before they have built sufficient fat reserves to survive the period of scarce food in the late summer and early fall.<ref name="stirling1999">{{cite journal |last1=Stirling |first1=Ian |last2=Lunn |first2=N.

[[File:Ursus maritimus Polar bear with cub 2.jpg|thumb|left|Mothers and cubs have high nutritional requirements, which are not met if the seal-hunting season is too short]]
In addition to creating nutritional stress, a warming climate is expected to affect various other aspects of polar bear life: Changes in sea ice affect the ability of pregnant females to build suitable maternity dens.<ref name="Schliebe 2006" /> As the distance increases between the pack ice and the coast, females must swim longer distances to reach favored denning areas on land.<ref name="derocher2004" /> Thawing of permafrost would affect the bears who traditionally den underground, and warm winters could result in den roofs collapsing or having reduced insulative value.<ref name="derocher2004" /> For the polar bears that currently den on multi-year ice, increased ice mobility may result in longer distances for mothers and young cubs to walk when they return to seal-hunting areas in the spring.<ref name="derocher2004" /> Disease-causing [[bacteria]] and [[parasite]]s would flourish more readily in a warmer climate.<ref name="amstrup2007" />

Problematic interactions between polar bears and humans, such as foraging by bears in garbage dumps, have historically been more prevalent in years when ice-floe breakup occurred early and local polar bears were relatively thin.<ref name="stirling2006" /> Increased human-bear interactions, including fatal attacks on humans, are likely to increase as the sea ice shrinks and hungry bears try to find food on land.<ref name="stirling2006" /><ref>Mitchell Taylor, a former polar bear researcher for the Nunavut government, thinks that Arctic warming has been caused by natural phenomena and is not a long-term threat to the polar bear. After his retirement, he was not re-appointed to the international Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), giving rise to speculation that he was excluded from the group because of his views on climate change. According to the PBSG chair, appointments to the PBSG are given to scientists who are currently active in polar bear research, and that as a retired researcher, Taylor did not qualify.

The effects of climate change are most profound in the southern part of the polar bear's range, and this is indeed where significant degradation of local populations has been observed.<ref name="acia" /> The Western Hudson Bay subpopulation, in a southern part of the range, also happens to be one of the best-studied polar bear subpopulations. This subpopulation feeds heavily on ringed seals in late spring, when newly weaned and easily hunted seal pups are abundant.<ref name="sd2007" /> The late spring hunting season ends for polar bears when the ice begins to melt and break up, and they fast or eat little during the summer until the sea freezes again.<ref name="sd2007" />

Due to warming air temperatures, ice-floe breakup in western Hudson Bay is currently occurring three weeks earlier than it did 30 years ago, reducing the duration of the polar bear feeding season.<ref name="sd2007" /> The body condition of polar bears has declined during this period; the average weight of lone (and likely pregnant) female polar bears was approximately {{convert|290|kg|abbr=on}} in 1980 and {{convert|230|kg|abbr=on}} in 2004.<ref name="sd2007" /> Between 1987 and 2004, the Western Hudson Bay population declined by 22%.<ref name="regehr2007">{{cite journal |last1=Regehr |first1=E.

A new development is that polars have begun ranging to new territory. While not unheard of but still uncommon Polar bears have been sighted increasingly in larger numbers ashore, staying on the mainland for longer periods of time during the summer months, particularly in North Canada, traveling farther inland.<ref>Harvey, Chelsea. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/11/18/polar-bears-are-spending-more-time-on-land-where-they-can-encounter-humans/ Next Up from Climate Change: More Polar Bears on Land, Potentially Running into Humans]" The Washington Post. Retrieved December 9, 2015</ref>

Foraging for new sources of food they have begun relying on mixed diets, incorporating seaweed, fish and whale carcasses that wash ashore<ref>Becker, Rachel A.(2015) "[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150904-polar-bears-dolphins-seals-climate-change/ 4 Ways Polar Bears are Dealing With Climate Change]" National Geographic. Retrieved December 9, 2015</ref> while trying to build up fat for the lean summer months.

An interesting addition to their diet is the Snow Goose Egg, providing a back up source of fat and nutrients, though not adequate for a polar bears diet.<ref>Becker, Rachel A.(2015) "[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150904-polar-bears-dolphins-seals-climate-change/ 4 Ways Polar Bears are Dealing With Climate Change]" National Geographic. Retrieved December 9, 2015</ref>

Traditionally, Polar bears eat marine animals for their high fat content and nutrients, land animals do not provide the adequate resources for their body to survive the harsher climates. Now scientists are suggesting some populations may have to adapt to land based diets.<ref>Marris, Emma. (2014) [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/07/140717-polar-bears-goose-eggs-global-warming-arctic-environment/ As Seas Ice Shrinks, Can Polar Bears Survive on Land?]" National Geographic.

These diets would consist mainly of goose eggs, waterfowl and Caribou.<ref>Marris, Emma.

Retrieved December 9, 2015</ref>

Another implication is as they remain on land for longer periods of time during the summer months Polar bears are coming into contact with people in higher frequency, foraging closer to urban areas.<ref>"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/11/18/polar-bears-are-spending-more-time-on-land-where-they-can-encounter-humans/ Next Up from Climate Change: More Polar Bears on Land, Potentially Running into Humans]" The Washington Post.

===Pollution===
Polar bears [[bioaccumulation|accumulate]] high levels of [[persistent organic pollutant]]s such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCBs) and chlorinated [[pesticides]]. Due to their position at the top of the [[ecological pyramid|food pyramid]], with a diet heavy in [[blubber]] in which halocarbons concentrate, their bodies are among the most contaminated of Arctic mammals.<ref name="ec_bulletin">{{cite web|url=http://www.arctic.uoguelph.ca/cpl/arcticnews/articles/PolarBears/PolarBear.htm|title=Polar Bears at the Top of POPs|date=May–June 2000|work=The Science and the Environment Bulletin|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=20 October 2008}}</ref> Halocarbons are known to be toxic to other animals, because they mimic [[hormone]] chemistry, and [[biomarker]]s such as [[immunoglobulin G]] and retinol suggest similar effects on polar bears. PCBs have received the most study, and they have been associated with birth defects and immune system deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00280-9|pmid=12505309|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5nwzfou68 |title=Ecological risk assessment of persistent organic pollutants in the arctic |journal=Toxicology |volume=181-182 |pages=193–7 |year=2002 |last1=Skaare |first1=J.

The most notorious of these chemicals, such as PCBs and [[DDT]], have been internationally banned. Their concentrations in polar bear tissues continued to rise for decades after the ban as these chemicals spread through the food chain. But the trend seems to have abated, with tissue concentrations of PCBs declining between studies performed from 1989 to 1993 and studies performed from 1996 to 2002.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.10.031|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5nwzfqHtP|pmid=16115663 |title=Chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants and metabolites in polar bears (''Ursus maritimus'') from Alaska, Canada, East Greenland, and Svalbard: 1996−2002 |journal=Science of the Total Environment |volume=351-352 |pages=369–90 |year=2005 |last1=Verreault |first1=J. |last2=Muir |first2=D.

===Oil and gas development===
Oil and gas development in polar bear habitat can affect the bears in a variety of ways. An [[oil spill]] in the Arctic would most likely concentrate in the areas where polar bears and their prey are also concentrated, such as sea ice leads.<ref name="iucn3.1" /> Because polar bears rely partly on their fur for insulation and soiling of the fur by oil reduces its insulative value, oil spills put bears at risk of dying from [[hypothermia]].<ref name="tick">{{cite book|last=Stirling |first=Ian |year=1988 |title=Polar Bears |location=Ann Arbor |authorlink=Ian Stirling (biologist) |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-10100-5 |chapter=What Makes a Polar Bear Tick?}}</ref> Polar bears exposed to oil spill conditions have been observed to lick the oil from their fur, leading to fatal kidney failure.<ref name="tick" /> Maternity dens, used by pregnant females and by females with infants, can also be disturbed by nearby oil exploration and development. Disturbance of these sensitive sites may trigger the mother to abandon her den prematurely, or abandon her litter altogether.<ref name="iucn3.1" />

==Protection in North America==
The polar bear is protected by many US laws, most notably the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] and the [[Endangered Species Act]]

===U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act===
Polar bears are protected under the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]], which prohibits the take (i.e., harass, hunt, capture, or kill) of all marine mammals.<ref name="ecos.fws.gov">{{cite web|last1=US Fish & Wildlife Service|title=Environmental Conservation Online System|url=http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=A0IJ}}</ref>

===U.S. Endangered Species Act===
On 14 May 2008 the U.S. Department of the Interior listed the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, citing the melting of Arctic sea ice as the primary threat to the polar bear.<ref name="ecos.fws.gov" />

===Canadian endangered species legislation===
"Canada has an important responsibility for the research, conservation, and management of polar bears because the majority of polar bears in the world occur within the nation’s borders. Two fundamental and recent changes for polar bears and their conservation in Canada have arisen: (1) the ongoing and projected further decline of sea-ice habitat as a result of climate change and (2) the implementation of aboriginal land claims and treaties in Canada’s North.<ref name="Peacock et al.">{{cite journal |last1=Peacock |first1=E. |last2=Derocher |first2=A.E. |last3=Thiemann |first3=G.W. |last4=Stirling |first4=I. |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |date=2011 |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=371–385 |doi=10.1139/z11-021 |url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z11-021#.VU8-UZOLWvk |accessdate=10 May 2015 |title=Conservation and management of Canada's polar bears (''Ursus maritimus'') in a changing Arctic}}</ref>

[[File:PolarBearWalrusTuskCarving.jpg|thumb|Engraving, made by [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] carvers in the 1940s on a [[walrus]] tusk, depicts polar bears hunting walrus]]

===Indigenous folklore===
For the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, polar bears have long played an important cultural and material role.<ref name="lw6-9">[[#Lockwood|Lockwood]], pp. 6–9</ref><ref name="Uspensky" /> Polar bear remains have been found at hunting sites dating to 2,500 to 3,000 years ago<ref name="lw31-36">[[#Lockwood|Lockwood]], pp. 31–36</ref> and 1,500-year-old [[cave painting]]s of polar bears have been found in the [[Chukchi Peninsula]].<ref name="Uspensky" /> Indeed, it has been suggested that Arctic peoples' skills in seal hunting and [[igloo]] construction has been in part acquired from the polar bears themselves.<ref name="Uspensky" />

The [[Inuit]] and [[Alaska Natives]] have many [[Folklore|folk tales]] featuring the bears including legends in which bears are humans when inside their own houses and put on bear hides when going outside, and stories of how the [[constellation]] that is said to resemble a great bear surrounded by dogs came into being.<ref name="original">{{cite book|last=Stirling |first=Ian |year=1988 |title=Polar Bears |location=Ann Arbor |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-10100-5 |chapter=The Original Polar Bear Watchers}}</ref> These legends reveal a deep respect for the polar bear, which is portrayed as both spiritually powerful and closely akin to humans.<ref name="original" /> The human-like posture of bears when standing and sitting, and the resemblance of a skinned bear carcass to the human body, have probably contributed to the belief that the spirits of humans and bears were interchangeable.<ref name="original" /> Eskimo legends tell of humans learning to hunt from the polar bear.

Among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] and [[Siberian Yupik|Yupik]] of eastern [[Siberia]], there was [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|a longstanding shamanistic ritual]] of "thanksgiving" to the hunted polar bear. After killing the animal, its head and skin were removed and cleaned and brought into the home, a feast was held in the hunting camp in its honor. In order to appease the spirit of the bear, there were traditional song and drum music and the skull would be ceremonially fed and offered a pipe.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kochnev AA, Etylin VM, Kavry VI, Siv-Siv EB, Tanko IV |title=Ritual Rites and Customs of the Natives of Chukotka connected with the Polar Bear|pages=1–3|publisher=Preliminary report submitted for the meeting of the Alaska Nanuuq Commission (Nome, Alaska, USA) |date=17–19 December 2002}}</ref> Only once the spirit was appeased would the skull be separated from the skin, taken beyond the bounds of the homestead, and placed in the ground, facing north.<ref name="Uspensky" /> Many of these traditions have faded somewhat in time, especially in light of the total hunting ban in the [[Soviet Union]] (and now Russia) since 1955.

The [[Nenet]]s of north-central Siberia placed particular value on the talismanic power of the prominent [[canine teeth]]. They were traded in the villages of the lower [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]] and [[Khatanga River|Khatanga]] rivers to the forest-dwelling peoples further south, who would sew them into their hats as protection against [[brown bear]]s. It was believed that the "little nephew" (the brown bear) would not dare to attack a man wearing the tooth of its powerful "big uncle" (the polar bear).<ref name="Uspensky" /> The skulls of killed polar bears were buried at specific sacred sites and altars, called ''sedyangi'', were constructed out of the skulls. Several such sites have been preserved on the [[Yamal Peninsula]].<ref name="Uspensky" />

===Symbols and mascots===

Their distinctive appearance and their association with the Arctic have made polar bears popular icons, especially in those areas where they are native. The Canadian [[Toonie]] (two-dollar coin) features the image of a polar bear and both the [[Vehicle registration plates of the Northwest Territories|Northwest Territories]] and [[Vehicle registration plates of Nunavut|Nunavut license plates]] in Canada are in the shape of a polar bear. The polar bear is the mascot of [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Maine]] and the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] (see also [[Alaska Nanooks]]) and was chosen as mascot for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Calgary]]. The [[Eisbären Berlin]] professional hockey team, playing in the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]] top-level pro hockey league of Germany uses a roaring polar bear (seen head-on) as their team logo.

Companies such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[Polar Beverages]], [[Nelvana]], [[Bundaberg Rum]] and [[Klondike bar|Good Humor-Breyers]] have used images of the polar bear in advertising,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bundabergrum.com.au|title=Bundaberg Rum Web site&nbsp;— history section |accessdate=26 March 2008 |work=Bundaberg Rum Web site}}</ref> while [[Fox's Glacier Mints]] have featured a polar bear named Peppy as the brand mascot since 1922. This has supported the popularity of the Polar bear, and it has since become one of a collection of creatures who are associated with [[Christmas]], including [[Penguins]], [[Reindeer]] and the [[European robin]].

===Fiction===
Polar bears are also popular in fiction, particularly in books aimed at children or teenagers. For example, ''[[The Polar Bear Son]]'' is adapted from a [[Inuit mythology|traditional Inuit tale]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The polar bear son: An Inuit tale |last=Dabcovich |first=Lydia |year=1997 |publisher=Clarion Books |location=New York |isbn=0-395-72766-9}}</ref> The [[animated television series]] ''[[Noah's Island]]'' features a polar bear named Noah as the protagonist.
